# market_analysis

## Welcome to the market_analysis wiki!

This mini project is trying to build a market analysis tool based on wow auction house data. I wish to gain good attention and know others who are also interested in market data analysis. It is highly appreciated if you could point out any mistake or suggest any improvement or give any idea related.

### # There are 3 goals to achieve:
* 1. Extract and store public data from the Internet. (using Java, completed)
* 2. Plot market trend and predict future market behavior, especially the price of goods. (using Python, yet to implement)
* 3. Analyze data and make useful suggestions, which users can reply on and make profit. (using Python, yet to implement)

### # Two aspects of improvement can be made in order to apply the program to wider world.
* 1. Expand, the core module and technique to real life data, for example, real market data, scientific research data, stock data and industrial machine status data.
* 2. Taking market factors into account to make prediction more precise. For example, if a substitute of a certain good has been found, the price of this good will be affected. If an item is frequently appraised in forum, the price of this item is foreseen to rise.

The method for plotting is 2nd order linear regression on price over time.
